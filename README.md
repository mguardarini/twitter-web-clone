# I tried to clone twitter web page

So, first of all, i was studing this library material-ui and decide tried to clone twitter web site, but when i developed the login interface. I thinked  find "Log in" button isnt cool or really beautiful, so i changed this button for something more cool ðŸŽ‰. Therefore this is my version of twitter web page.
